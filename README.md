# BrandVoice

**AI Content Generation with Brand Consistency**

A proof-of-concept demonstrating brand-consistent, multi-platform social media content generation - built for AilandMedia.

## 🎯 The Problem

Businesses struggle to maintain consistent brand voice when creating content across multiple social media platforms. Generic AI tools produce content that sounds robotic and doesn't reflect brand personality.

## 💡 The Solution

BrandVoice demonstrates how AI can generate platform-optimized content (LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Instagram) while maintaining a consistent brand voice based on:
- Brand profile (tone, industry, target audience)
- Example posts that define the brand's style
- Content briefs with specific topics and CTAs
